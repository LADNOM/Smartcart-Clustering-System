📊 Customer Response Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the SmartCart Customers Dataset to predict customer response based on demographic and spending behavior.
The project includes complete data preprocessing, feature engineering, outlier detection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Key Features
✔ Handle Missing Values
✔ Feature Engineering (Age, Total Spending, Total Children)
✔ Outlier Detection & Removal
✔ Correlation Heatmap Analysis
✔ Data Visualization (Pairplot, Distribution Plots)
✔ Customer Response Prediction (Classification)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information:
The dataset contains customer information, including:
Income
Education
Marital Status
Recency
Total Spending
Number of Children
Customer Response (Target Variable)
Total Records: ~2240
After Cleaning: ~2230 (Outliers Removed)

⚙️ Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in the Income column
Converted categorical variables
Dropped unnecessary columns
2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Created Age from Year_Birth
Created Total Spending column
Created the Total Children feature
3️⃣ Outlier Detection
Visualized using pairplot
Removed extreme values
4️⃣ Correlation Analysis
Generated a heatmap to analyze feature relationships
📊 Visualizations
Pairplot (Income, Recency, Age, Total Spending)
Correlation Heatmap
Distribution Plots

🎯 Objective:
To analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will respond to marketing campaigns.
🔮 Future Improvements:
Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
Hyperparameter tuning
Deploy using Streamlit
Create Dashboard
