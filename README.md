Key Features
✔ Handle Missing Values
✔ Feature Engineering (Age, Total Spending, Total Children)
✔ Outlier Detection & Removal
✔ Correlation Heatmap Analysis
✔ Data Visualization (Pairplot, Distribution Plots)
✔ Customer Response Prediction (Classification)

The dataset contains customer information, including:
Income
Education
Marital Status
Recency
Total Spending
Number of Children
Customer Response (Target Variable)
Total Records: ~2240
After Cleaning: ~2230 (Outliers Removed)

Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in the Income column
Converted categorical variables
Dropped unnecessary columns
2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Created Age from Year_Birth
Created Total Spending column
Created the Total Children feature
3️⃣ Outlier Detection
Visualized using pairplot
Removed extreme values
4️⃣ Correlation Analysis
Generated a heatmap to analyze feature relationships
📊 Visualizations

Objective
To analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will respond to marketing campaigns.
🔮 Future Improvements
Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
Hyperparameter tuning
Deploy using Streamlit
Create Dashboard
Pairplot (Income, Recency, Age, Total Spending)
Correlation Heatmap
Distribution Plots
